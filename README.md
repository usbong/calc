# Development Logs

1. Create the appearance first. Without yet interactivity.<br/>

<img src="https://github.com/usbong/calc/blob/main/screenshots/calcScreenshotV20260427T1507.png" width="60%">

2. 20260428; http://store.usbong.ph/server/calc/index20260428.html<br/>
Add basic arithmetic: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

3. 20260429; http://store.usbong.ph/server/calc/index20260429.html<br/>
+added: backspace<br/>
+fixed: equals button not correctly displayed in newer browsers<br/>
+fixed: error when operator is added before adding any operand

4. 20260430; http://store.usbong.ph/server/calc/index20260430.html<br/>
+fixed: backspace error when there's only a digit left after doing an operation; "sCurrOperand" incorrectly set to Float, instead of String<br/>
+fixed: backspace error when the operator is backspaced, then a new operator cannot anymore be added<br/>
+added: decimal point<br/>
+added: max 11 digits for the resulting answer if it has a decimal point<br/>
+added: max 13 operands and operators including the decimal point<br/>
+added: "Clear" button which replaces the "Backspace" button after using the equals operator; then, again bring back the "Backspace" button upon entering an operand or an operator<br/>
+updated: multiply symbol to "×"<br/>
+updated: multiply symbol to "÷"<br/>
+updated: equals button position to "136px;" from "136.5px;"

<img src="https://github.com/usbong/calc/blob/main/screenshots/calcScreenshotV20260430T1447.png" width="60%">

5. 20260501; http://store.usbong.ph/server/calc/index20260501.html<br/>
+added: current operator can be changed at its position<br/>
+set: temporarily input box to read-only to prevent intentional or inadvertent entering of text via keyboard 

6. 20260502; http://store.usbong.ph/server/calc/index20260502.html<br/>
+fixed: pressing equals button multiple times causes next arithmetic operation to result to zero<br/>
+removed: reset function via pressing equals button; instead, use "Clear" button<br/>
+fixed: certain sequences that lead to incorrect output;<br/>
**Examples:** `3*/B*` error, `5*60=*B==/2` error<br/>
+added: changeable number signs<br/>
+fixed: `3/=5`; previously resulted to `05`; now results to `5`<br/>
TODO: -fix: `3*-B` becomes `3`, instead of `3*`<br/>
TODO: -fix: `-*B` now removes both `-*`

7. 20260504; http://store.usbong.ph/server/calc/index20260504.html<br/>
+fixed: `3*-B` becomes `3`, instead of `3*`<br/>
+fixed: `-*B` now removes both `-*`; `-*` already results to `<blank>`<br/>
+fixed: `-*` should result to `<blank>`<br/>
+fixed: backspace in `3x-` incorrectly results to `3` instead of `3x`<br/>
TODO: -add: PEMDAS

<img src="https://github.com/usbong/calc/blob/main/plan/pemdasPlan20260504.jpg" width="60%">

8. 20260505; http://store.usbong.ph/server/calc/index20260505.html<br/>
+added: PEMDAS without yet the parenthesis<br/>
+tested: to output the correct answer with the following:<br/>
`6*2+1=13`<br/>
`1+2*6=13`<br/>
`3-1*6+2=-1`<br/>
`1-3+2=0`<br/>
`1*3/6=0.5`<br/>
`2*5/3=3.333333333`<br/>

9. 20260506; BUGGY<br/>
+added: work-in-progress function to process the parentheses with code for debugging purposes

<img src="https://github.com/usbong/calc/blob/main/plan/pemdasPlanParenthesis20260506.jpg" width="60%">

10. 20260507; BUGGY<br/>
+updated: work-in-progress function to process the parentheses with code for debugging purposes; can now prepare the input to be processed<br/> 
**Example:**<br/> 
**input:** `2*(1-(1+2*6))`<br/>
**output:** `1+2*6`

11. 20260508; BUGGY<br/>
+updated: function to process the parentheses; can now output correctly given the input; though not yet integrated with the rest of the code<br/> 
**Example:**<br/> 
**input:** `2×(1-(1+2×6))`<br/> 
**process:** `2×(1-A)`<br/>
**output:** `2×(1-13)`<br/>

12. 20260509; BUGGY<br/>
+updated: function to process the parentheses; gradually getting integrated with the rest of the code;<br/>
+noted: opted to add code that reads the input as a string of characters, which is auto-processed, identifying which are operands and which are operators, while storing them in the correct sequence;<br/>
+noted: right now, the first set inside the parentheses from the right has to be manually identified and then put into `arrayOperator` and `arrayOperand`<br/>
**Example:**<br/> 
**input:** `3×(1-2)`<br/> 
**process:** `3×-1`<br/> 
**output (CORRECT):** `-3`<br/> 
TODO: -reverify: with other example cases, e.g. `2×(1-(1+2×6))`<br/>
TODO: -add: `3(5)` which is equal to `3×5`<br/>  
				
13. 20260510; http://store.usbong.ph/server/calc/index20260510.html<br/>
+reverted: to version 20260505 with updates such as:<br>
+updated: to allow only one operator; due to `9/3*2`; error where `9/(3*2)` is done instead of `(9/3)*2`<br/>
+fixed: `3*3-B3=` results to error; by changing `B` to `C` ("Clear") to prevent the user from pressing backspace; other cases such as `3*3-=` are already giving the correct outputs;<br>

# NEW CALC PLUS

14. 20260512; BUGGY<br/>
+added: auto-scaled user-interface based on whether user's device is mobile or not;<br/>
TODO: -fix: display issues, e.g. equals button (absolute position), on iPad<br/>
TODO: -fix: `280/(1.12)` and `60*0.12` resulting to non-whole number due to approximated value caused by computer's basic characteristic of using binary representations; solution says Google AI Overview is: Integer "Cents" Trick; however, parameter `2` in `toFixed(2)` should be auto-adjusted based on the number of places after the decimal point<br/>
TODO: -fix: max digits reached resulting to an incorrect answer displayed<br/>
TODO: -add: processing of parentheses<br/>

<img src="https://github.com/usbong/calc/blob/main/screenshots/calcScreenshotV20260512T1426.png" width="60%">

<img src="https://github.com/usbong/calc/blob/main/screenshots/calcScreenshotMobileV20260512T1430.jpg" width="30%">

15. 20260513; http://store.usbong.ph/server/calc/calc20260513.html<br/>
+fixed: `280/(1.12)` and `60*0.12` resulting to non-whole number;<br/> 
+added: a function to auto-count how many places there are after the decimal point; the count is used as parameter to `toFixed(...)`<br/>

16. 20260514; http://store.usbong.ph/server/calc/calc20260514.html<br/>
+fixed: incorrect output when doing division; `280/(1.12)` now outputs the correct answer;<br/>
+noted: without using scientific notations like exponents, there's no way to get a result greater than `999,999,999,999` (12 digits) using at most 12 digits summing the number of digits that the two operands have;<br/>
+fixed: display issues, e.g. equals button (absolute position), on iPad<br/>
+noted: padding-right and padding-left have to be set to `0` to fix display issues on iPad; also used "em" instead of "px" for certain button fields;<br/>
+updated: "BackSpace" to "BACKSPACE";<br/>
+updated: "Clear" to "CLEAR";<br/>
+added: browser tab icon<br/>

<img src="https://github.com/usbong/calc/blob/main/screenshots/calcScreenshotIpadMobilePortraitResizedV20260514T1333.png" width="30%">

17. 20260515; http://store.usbong.ph/server/calc/calc20260515.html<br/>
+updated: to use max available browser width and height if the user is using non-mobile or desktop;<br/>
+updated: to identify if user is using an iPad or MacBook, and adjust the browser width or height available for use accordingly; <br/>
+added: keyboard inputs (keys near numlock or top of keyboard)<br/>
+added: when "=" is pressed, and "CLEAR" button is activated, perform reset();<br/>
+updated: calc fav icon to use the transparent/alpha color;<br/>
TODO: -add: processing of parentheses<br/>

18. 20260516; http://store.usbong.ph/server/calc/calc20260516.html<br/>
+added: auto-focus on the `AnswerInput` so that when `/` is pressed on the keyboard, "Quick find" on Firefox browser isn't opened<br/>
+added: relevant keys other than those near the numlock could be pressed, including those combined with SHIFT down<br/>
+noted: display error when the following is used:<br/>
`<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="./assets/images/calcfavicon.png?lastmod=20260516T0953">`<br/>
instead of:<br/> 
`<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="./assets/images/calcfavicon.png">`<br/>
+noted: focusing on creating a "solid" app rather than a buggy one by adding more extra features, e.g. processing of parentheses;<br/>
+added: ESCAPE key to do a `reset()`;<br/>
+updated: max digits to be `14` instead of `12`; though equals sign is allowed to be pressed as the 15th input<br/>
+increased: length of `AnswerInput`'s display to show no partly drawn characters<br/>
+fixed: width too long for standard Android via changing it from `260px` to `240px`<br/>
+updated: equals sign function to continue to process operation even when the BACKSPACE button displays "CLEAR" when there's an operator in `answerInput`<br/>
+fixed: focused `AnswerInput` not displayed uniformly with Firefox, Chrome, Safari on Edge<br/>

19. 20260518; http://store.usbong.ph/server/calc/calc20260518.html<br/> 
+added: when a new operator is entered, calc performs the operation if an existing operator is already present and then adds the new operator;<br/> 
+updated: increased width of buttons, and their positions accordingly;<br/> 
+updated: ESCAPE key to `reset()` and then execute`inputOperator("=")`<br/>

20. 20260519; http://store.usbong.ph/server/calc/calc20260519.html<br/> 
+removed: debug-related comments, thereby reducing the file size from 55KB to 30KB;<br/>
+removed: blinking border effect in `AnswerInput` whenever a button is mouse-clicked;<br/>
+tested: calc functionality; now as usable as how I use the calculator in my day-to-day working life;<br/> 

21. 20260520; http://store.usbong.ph/server/calc/calc20260520.html<br/> 
+updated: output to make sure that all the digits to the left of the decimal point are present;<br/>
+opted: to keep the decimal point even if the numbers to its right aren't anymore displayed due to max length reached;

<img src="https://github.com/usbong/calc/blob/main/screenshots/calcScreenshotV20260520T1514.png" width="50%">

22. 20260522; http://store.usbong.ph/server/calc/calc20260522.html<br/>
+fixed: `.-6` incorrectly results to `0` instead of `-6`, because `.` (not a number) is now set to `0`;<br/>
+fixed: `.6*6` incorrectly results to `3.599...` instead of `3.6`;<br/>
+fixed: `1.12*100` incorrectly results to `112.00000000000001`, instead of `112` by using `Math.round` after multiplying by the power of `10` raised to a specified number based on the input operands; didn't anymore use `Number.EPSILON` due to incorrect result if operand is `0`;<br/>
+fixed: `0/0=5` incorrectly results to `Err5`, instead of `5`;<br/>
+updated: font size to `1.7rem` for Android, while the default is `1.9rem`; adjusted button font size and position accordingly;<br/>
+increased: `AnswerInput` width on iPad due to additional one digit accepted;<br/>
+updated: when `AnswerInput` is `Err` as a result of `0/0`, for example, pressing any of the operators (except `-`) results to `0`; meanwhile, when `-` is pressed, `-` is immediately put instead of `0`;<br/>
+updated: `0` cannot be added to the left unless there's a `.`<br/>

## Additional Bug Fixes

23. 20260605; http://store.usbong.ph/server/calc/calc.html<br/>
+updated: icon<br/>
+noted: use of `calcalphaicon20260605.png` instead of `calcalphaiconUpdated.png` causes error in the display of `×` and `÷`<br/>
+fixed: `4362.75 - 4019.80` results to `342.9499999` instead of `342.95`;<br/>
+fixed: `0.2 + 0.1` results to `0.300000000` instead of `0.3`; referencing Google AI Overview with question: "example binary representation accuracy with addition?"<br/>
+fixed: `.` cannot be entered when `CLEAR` is displayed instead of `BACKSPACE`<br/>
