2. 20260428; http://store.usbong.ph/server/calc/index20260428.html<br/>
Add basic arithmetic: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

3. 20260429; http://store.usbong.ph/server/calc/index20260429.html<br/>
+added: backspace<br/>
+fixed: equals button not correctly displayed in newer browsers<br/>
+fixed: error when operator is added before adding any operand

4. 20260430; http://store.usbong.ph/server/calc/index20260430.html<br/>
+fixed: backspace error when there's only a digit left after doing an operation; "sCurrOperand" incorrectly set to Float, instead of String<br/>
+fixed: backspace error when the operator is backspaced, then a new operator cannot anymore be added<br/>
+added: decimal point<br/>
+added: max 11 digits for the resulting answer if it has a decimal point<br/>
+added: max 13 operands and operators including the decimal point<br/>
+added: "Clear" button which replaces the "Backspace" button after using the equals operator; then, again bring back the "Backspace" button upon entering an operand or an operator<br/>

5. 20260501; http://store.usbong.ph/server/calc/index20260501.html<br/>
+added: current operator can be changed at its position<br/>
+set: temporarily input box to read-only to prevent intentional or inadvertent entering of text via keyboard 

6. 20260502; http://store.usbong.ph/server/calc/index20260502.html<br/>
+fixed: pressing equals button multiple times causes next arithmetic operation to result to zero<br/>
+removed: reset function via pressing equals button; instead, use "Clear" button<br/>
+fixed: certain sequences that lead to incorrect output;<br/>
**Examples:** `3*/B*` error, `5*60=*B==/2` error<br/>
+added: changeable number signs<br/>
+fixed: `3/=5`; previously resulted to `05`; now results to `5`<br/>
TODO: -fix: `3*-B` becomes `3`, instead of `3*`<br/>
TODO: -fix: `-*B` now removes both `-*`

7. 20260504; http://store.usbong.ph/server/calc/index.html<br/>
+fixed: `3*-B` becomes `3`, instead of `3*`<br/>
+fixed: `-*B` now removes both `-*`; `-*` already results to `<blank>`<br/>
+fixed: `-*` should result to `<blank>`<br/>
+fixed: backspace in `3x-` incorrectly results to `3` instead of `3x`<br/>
TODO: -add: PEMDAS

8. 20260505 (CURRENT); http://store.usbong.ph/server/calc/index.html<br/>
+added: PEMDAS without yet the parenthesis<br/>
+tested: to output the correct answer with the following:<br/>
`6*2+1=13`<br/>
`1+2*6=13`<br/>
`3-1*6+2=-1`<br/>
`1-3+2=0`<br/>
`1*3/6=0.5`<br/>
`2*5/3=3.333333333`<br/>
